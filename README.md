🛒 Sales Prediction Model<br>
This project is a Sales Prediction System that utilizes Random Forest Regressor to predict sales based on historical data. The model is trained using machine learning and features a frontend website for user interaction.

📌 Features<br>
✅ Predicts sales based on historical data<br>
✅ Uses Random Forest Regressor for accurate predictions<br>
✅ Visualizes feature importance, error distribution, and actual vs. predicted sales<br>
✅ Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend<br>
✅ Backend supports model deployment using Flask/FastAPI (if applicable)<br>

📂 Dataset<br>
The dataset is sourced from Big Sales Data <br>
It contains product sales information with various features <br>
Preprocessing includes handling missing values and encoding categorical variables <br>
